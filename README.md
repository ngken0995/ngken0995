# Kenneth Ng

Welcome to my GitHub!

Some things about me:
 - My IDE setup: Sublime Text + Terminal / VSCode
 - Goto language: Python3

Activity I love:
 - Yoga
 - Rock climbing
 
Resume hacks:
 - If you're in Google Docs/Microsoft Word, use a table without borders or padding to clean up row spacing
 - Make your margins 0.5 inch to fit more stuff
 - Try to make bullet points take up the whole line and try not to go over by one or two words
